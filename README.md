Some details will come soon!

For now, this is a 1.16.5 Paper/spigot plugin to only allow one person at a time inside of a chest.
While someone is looking inside of a chest and another person tries to access the chest, they will be told that someone is already in there and to wait. 

A custom plugin for Stone Legion, however I'm releasing this to the public for potential enjoyment for those who might be interested in these features. 

The code is very hard coded and not able to be simply changed via a config file, in the future I will be adding plenty of configurable options, and potentially easy integration with a set of other plugins.
many things are TBD due to this plugin being mainly designed for custom server purposes!
